# TODO.md - Chapter 3: Implementing Machine Learning Algorithms with Scikit-learn

## Objective

Develop a machine learning model to classify wheat grain varieties using physical characteristics, applying the CRISP-DM methodology.  

## Tasks

### Analyze and Preprocess the Data
- [x] Create a notebook file (`.ipynb`) using Jupyter (locally) or Google Colab (cloud).
- [x] Download the "Seeds Dataset" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/236/seeds>
- [x] Import the "Seeds" dataset and display the first rows to understand its structure.
- [x] Compute descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for each feature.
- [x] Handle any missing values in the dataset.
- [x] Visualize feature distributions using:
  - [x] Histograms.
  - [x] Boxplots.
- [x] Use scatter plots to identify relationships between features.
- [x] Assess the need for feature scaling and apply normalization or standardization if necessary.

### Implement and Compare Classification Algorithms
- [x] Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 70% training, 30% testing).
- [x] Choose at least three classification algorithms, such as:
  - [x] K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
  - [x] Support Vector Machine (SVM).
  - [x] Random Forest.
  - [x] Naive Bayes.
  - [x] Logistic Regression.
- [x] Train each model using the training set.
- [x] Evaluate each model on the test set using:
  - [x] Accuracy.
  - [x] Precision.
  - [x] Recall.
  - [x] F1-score.
  - [x] Confusion matrices.
- [x] Compare the performance of all algorithms.

### Optimize the Models (if necessary)
- [x] Use Grid Search or Randomized Search to identify the best hyperparameters for each model.
- [x] Retrain each model using the best-found hyperparameters.
- [x] Re-evaluate the optimized models on the test set using:
  - [x] Accuracy.
  - [x] Precision.
  - [x] Recall.
  - [x] F1-score.
  - [x] Confusion matrices.
- [x] Check for significant improvements in performance.

### Interpret Results and Extract Insights
- [x] Analyze the performance of each model in detail.
- [x] Summarize key insights and conclusions about the problem and the models used.
- [x] Relate the results to the wheat grain classification context.
